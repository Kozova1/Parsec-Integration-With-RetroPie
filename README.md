## Please read ALL of the information here


This is a script for integrating Parsec with RetroPie.
Works ONLY on Raspberry Pi.
At the moment the script only supports the Carbon and Pixel Themes
# Please Backup your system before running this script

## Installation

### First find out your Peer id by clicking on the Computers Tab in the Parsec app.

## There are 2 methods to install this:
### 1st method (Experimental, use 2nd method if this one doesn't work):
### Run the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kozova1/Parsec-Integration-With-RetroPie/master/curlsetup.sh && sh curlsetup.sh
```
### 2nd method:
### Run the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
  1. sudo apt install git
  2. git clone https://github.com/Kozova1/Parsec-Integration-With-RetroPie.git
  3. cd Parsec-Integration-With-RetroPie
  4. ./setup.sh -nodrv
```
Follow the instructions on screen.
After the script finishes it's work it's recommended to restart 'EmulationStation' or your Raspberry Pi.
You should see a 'Parsec'  console option in EmulationStation
Login with your [parsec](https://parsecgaming.com) account.
Click Connect on your desired PC.
Now you can run Parsec via RetroPie! Have fun gaming!

# DISCLAIMER
1. I am not responsible for any loss of data, hardware etc. You take full responsibility.
2. Setup.sh alters your installation such that **future updates of RetroPie will not effect es_systems.cfg**. If this is not desirable, use port_setup.sh in step 4 in the 2nd installation method instead setup.sh. This will add a Parsec option in the Ports menu of RetroPie.
> Note: in the future, you will have to manually update /home/pi/.emulationstation/es_systems.cfg, as it will not be overwritten by RetroPie updates.


# IF YOU GET ERROR -2001 DO THIS:
1. Press CTRL + ALT + F2
(Bonus): Figure out how to use my parsec theme yourself.
